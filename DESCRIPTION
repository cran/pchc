Description: Bayesian network learning using the PCHC algorithm. PCHC stands for PC Hill-Climbing. It is a new hybrid algorithm that used PC to construct the skeleton of the BN and then 
			       utilizes the Hill-Climbing greedy search. More algorithms and variants have been added, such as MMHC, FEDHC, and the Tabu search variants, PCTABU, MMTABU and FEDTABU. The relevant papers are
