Description: Bayesian network learning using the PCHC algorithm. PCHC stands for PC Hill-Climbing. It is a new hybrid algorithm that used PC to construct the skeleton of the BN and then utilizes the Hill-Climbing greedy search. The relevant paper is: Tsagris M. (2021). "A new scalable Bayesian network learning algorithm with applications to economics". Computational Economics (Accepted for publication). <doi:10.1007/s10614-020-10065-7>.
